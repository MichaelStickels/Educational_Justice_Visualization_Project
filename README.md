# Educational_Justice_Visualization_Project
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?
  - We are interested in analyzing educational data because it often shows social injustice. Indicators such as school amenities, school funding, graduation rate, dropout rate, and more can all show how districts are receiving disproportionately low support. We would also like to investigate how grade school data relates to post-graduation data. If able, we are interested in analyzing how access to environmental education and outdoor spaces also impacts students once they are out of grade school (such impacts could include belief in climate change). Social and environmental justice are connected because climate change will disproportionately impact low-income communities (and due to systematic injustices people of color disproportionately make up low income communities). We believe that education data may highlight many of these injustices and are interested in uncovering some these problems. It is critical that we continue uncovering social and environmental injustices to protect the health and well-being of all communities.
